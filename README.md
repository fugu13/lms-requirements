LMS Requirements

A version of the functional, non-functional, and technical requirements used at a Major Canadian University when running an LMS RFP.

There are **way** too many line items in this, which **will** bog down the ranking process. So, trim at will. But it's likely a good starting point.

non-functional requirements? yeah. Things that are properties of the system, rather than features themselves. like, "it should be easy to use…" etc…
